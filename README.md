# MREyeTrack
MREyeTrack is a fully automated framework to analyse eye kinematics in MR data, as described in *link_to_upcoming_publication*.

## Demo Dataset
This demo dataset consists of the following three exemplary MR scans of the same participant:
* T2_weighted_3D_scan.mat
* bSFFP_Saccade_Axial.mat
* bSSFP_Slow_Blink.mat
 
The first is a static, 3D, T2-weighted scan which was obtained while the participant was fixating a target dot at central position between the eyes. The second is a dynamic, 2D, bSSFP scan in the axial plane while the participant performed fast eye movements (saccades) between targets at -7° and 7°. The third is also a bSSFP scan, this time in the sagittal plane, while the particpant performed slow blinks around every 3 seconds.
